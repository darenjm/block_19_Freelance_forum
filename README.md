Getting Started
There is no starter code for this workshop. However, the solution is very similar to the Shapes guided practice. You are encouraged to use that repository as a starting point for this workshop.

Create a new repository named Unit2.FreelancerForum on GitHub and clone it down.
Add your cohort team to the repository you just made.
Open the project with VS Code and create an HTML file and a JavaScript file.
Figure out a plan for what code you will need to write based on the user story. Use the rubric to guide you.
